    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Eggs are a versatile and nutritious food, known for their rich, tender yolks and firm, protein-packed whites. They can be cooked in a variety of ways—boiled, scrambled, fried, or poached—and are often used as a key ingredient in baking and cooking for their binding and leavening properties.</p>

        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>

    </ul>

        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat and add a small pat of butter or oil.</li>
