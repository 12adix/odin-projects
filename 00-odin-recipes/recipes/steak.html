    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Steak is a flavorful cut of beef, typically grilled, pan-seared, or broiled to achieve a perfect balance of crispy exterior and tender, juicy interior. Depending on the cut, it can range from lean and firm to marbled with rich fat, which adds extra flavor and tenderness. Often seasoned simply with salt and pepper, a well-cooked steak is a satisfying and hearty dish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the steak with salt, pepper, and any desired spices, then let it rest at room temperature for about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill over high heat, adding a small amount of oil or butter.</li>
        <li>Place the steak on the hot surface and cook for 3-5 minutes on each side (depending on thickness and desired doneness).</li>
        <li>Use tongs to flip the steak only once for a nice sear, and check for doneness with a meat thermometer.</li>
        <li>Let the steak rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing and serving to allow the juices to redistribute.</li>
